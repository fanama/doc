 # Methodologies that can be
used to tackle different types of problems:

### 1. **Root Cause Analysis (RCA)**
   - **Purpose:** Identifies the fundamental reason or causes behind an issue, helping in effective problem
resolution.
   - **Methodology:**
     - Gather Data: Collect relevant data and information about the problem.
     - Identify Symptoms: List out all symptoms related to the problem.
     - Hypothesize Causes: Develop potential root cause hypotheses based on the symptoms.
     - Test Hypotheses: Evaluate each hypothesis for its validity by collecting more data or conducting tests.
     - Implement Solutions: Once a valid root cause is identified, implement solutions and monitor their
effectiveness.

### 2. **Six Sigma Methodology**
   - **Purpose:** A structured approach to problem-solving that focuses on reducing variation in processes to
achieve high levels of performance.
   - **Methodology:**
     - DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control): This is a core process for improvement projects within
Six Sigma organizations.
       - Define: Identify the project’s goals and stakeholders.
       - Measure: Collect data about current processes to assess their performance.
       - Analyze: Use statistical tools to understand root causes of problems or process inefficiencies.
       - Improve: Develop strategies to address identified issues. Implement changes based on these improvements.
       - Control: Establish measures for ongoing monitoring and management.

### 3. **PDCA Cycle (Plan-Do-Check-Act)**
   - **Purpose:** A cyclical, iterative, problem-solving approach often used in quality control processes.
   - **Methodology:**
     - Plan: Develop a strategy or set of steps to address the issue.
     - Do: Implement the plan and execute the actions.
     - Check: Monitor and measure results against planned objectives. Identify any issues that need attention.
     - Act (Implement Change): Address problems identified in the check phase, implement changes as necessary.

### 4. **The Five Whys**
   - **Purpose:** A technique to determine the root cause of a problem by asking “Why?” repeatedly until you get
to the core issue.
   - **Methodology:**
     - Start with the immediate result or symptom.
     - Ask "Why" for each step backward in the chain of events. Continue asking "Why" at each level until you
reach a fundamental reason.

### 5. **The Problem-Solving Model by John P. Kotter**
   - **Purpose:** A model to tackle organizational challenges effectively and efficiently.
   - **Methodology:**
     - Define the problem clearly.
     - Brainstorm potential solutions. Encourage creativity and gather input from various stakeholders.
     - Evaluate options. Consider feasibility, risks, benefits, and resources required.
     - Implement selected solution. Allocate necessary resources and set timelines.
     - Monitor progress and evaluate outcomes. Adjust as needed to ensure successful resolution.

### 6. **TRIZ (Theory of Inventive Problem Solving)**
   - **Purpose:** A systematic approach for problem-solving that involves using a series of steps to find
innovative solutions to technical problems.
   - **Methodology:**
     - Identify the core issue or technological limitation as described by Konstantin Trzileiko (also known as
Genrich Altshuller, who developed TRIZ).
     - Apply TRIZ principles such as Technical Parameters and Intellectual Properties to generate creative ideas.

### 7. **The Five Whack-a-Doodle Method**
   - **Purpose:** A method for generating solutions by brainstorming without any rules or constraints.
   - **Methodology:**
     - List the problem in detail.
     - Create a list of everything you know about it, including pros and cons.
     - Consider what’s holding things back. Write down everything that might be holding up your progress.

### 8. **The SWOT Analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats)**
   - **Purpose:** Identifying internal strengths and weaknesses of a situation or project along with external
opportunities and threats.
   - **Methodology:**
     - List out the internal factors (strengths and weaknesses).
     - Identify potential opportunities in your environment.
     - Recognize any external threats that could affect the project or issue.

### 9. **Storyboard Method for Problem Solving**
   - **Purpose:** A technique to visualize problem-solving steps.
   - **Methodology:**
     - Create a visual map of all steps involved in addressing the issue, including brainstorming solutions and
planning actions.
     - Use this framework to ensure that you don’t overlook any critical aspects.

### 10. **The Problem-Solving Process by Drucker (Focus on Results)**
   - **Purpose:** A method to focus on results rather than processes, which can help in directing energy towards
achieving desired outcomes.
   - **Methodology:**
     - Clearly define the goal or objective you are trying to achieve.
     - Break down the problem into smaller components. Identify key milestones and actions required.
     - Establish a plan of action with clear timelines and responsible parties.
     - Monitor progress regularly against your objectives.
