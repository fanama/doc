Okay, here are 5 open-ended logic questions, varying in difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard), with a little note about *why* I think they fall into that category.  I'll also include a section at the end about potential ways to approach them, without giving full solutions.

**Important:** These are *open-ended*.  There isn't necessarily *one* right answer, but some answers will be more logical and well-supported than others.  The point is to demonstrate reasoning.

**1. (Easy) The Lost Key**

* **Scenario:**  You come home and realize you've lost your house key. You remember having it at three places today: the grocery store, the park, and the library. You *don't* remember exactly where you last had it. You *do* remember you were feeling rushed at the grocery store and likely just tossed it into your bag. At the park, you were actively using it to lock your bike. At the library, you were very focused on a book and sat at a table for a long time.
* **Question:** Where would you search *first*, and *why*? Explain your reasoning.

* **Difficulty:** Easy.  This relies on simple probability and applying common sense to the given details.  It focuses on weighting likelihood.

**2. (Medium) The Mysterious Gift**

* **Scenario:** Three friends – Alice, Bob, and Carol – each received a gift from an anonymous benefactor. They know the gifts are a book, a movie, and a video game, but not who received what. They also know the following:
    * Alice doesn’t like to read.
    * Bob is not interested in playing video games.
    * Carol said she was hoping for something she could enjoy on a rainy day.
* **Question:**  Can you definitively determine who received which gift? Explain your reasoning, and if not, what further information would you need?

* **Difficulty:** Medium. This requires a bit of deductive reasoning and the ability to eliminate possibilities. It’s a classic-style logic puzzle, but because the clues aren't *completely* definitive, there's room for discussion about what constitutes proof.

**3. (Medium) The Island of Truth-Tellers and Liars**

* **Scenario:** You land on an island inhabited by two types of people: Truth-tellers, who *always* tell the truth, and Liars, who *always* lie.  You meet a person.  You ask them, "Are you a Truth-teller?" They respond with a single word that you can’t understand - it’s in a language you don’t know.
* **Question:**  What can you conclude about the person you met? Explain your reasoning. (Hint: think about what a Truth-teller would have to say if they *could* answer in a language you understood.)

* **Difficulty:** Medium. This requires a bit of abstract thought and looking at the problem from multiple perspectives. It's a variation on a classic island riddle, made interesting by the unknown language.

**4. (Hard) The Color of the Hats**

* **Scenario:** Three logicians – Alex, Ben, and Clara – are blindfolded. A hat is placed on each of their heads.  They are told that each hat is either red or blue, and that there's at least one red hat. They are then able to remove their blindfolds but *cannot* see the color of their own hat. They are forbidden from communicating in any way beyond verbal statements.  After a period of silence, Alex says, “I do not know the color of my hat.”  Ben then says, “I also do not know the color of my hat.”  Clara then confidently declares, “I know the color of my hat!”
* **Question:** What color is Clara’s hat, and how did she deduce it? Explain the logic step-by-step.

* **Difficulty:** Hard. This is a challenging logic puzzle involving iterated reasoning – each person's statement provides information to the others. It requires simulating the thought process of each logician.

**5. (Hard) The Defective Coin**

* **Scenario:** You have 100 coins.  You know that exactly one of the coins is defective – meaning it’s a different weight than the others (you don't know if it's heavier or lighter). You have a balance scale.
* **Question:** What is the *minimum* number of weighings required to guarantee you can identify the defective coin and determine whether it’s heavier or lighter, and explain the strategy you would use?

* **Difficulty:** Hard. This is a classic puzzle that combines logical deduction with information theory.  It’s harder than it seems because you need to consider both the coin *identity* and the direction of the weight difference. Optimal solutions usually involve a clever divide-and-conquer approach.

**General Approaches to These Questions:**

*   **Write it down:** For many logic puzzles, making a chart, diagram, or list of possibilities can be incredibly helpful.
*   **Eliminate Possibilities:**  Focus on what *cannot* be true, based on the information given.
*   **Consider All Perspectives:** Especially in the 'island' and 'hat' puzzles, try to think what each person would be thinking and how their statements affect others.
*   **"What if?" Scenarios:**  Play out different scenarios to see if they lead to contradictions.
*   **Look for Hidden Assumptions:**  Are there any unspoken rules or assumptions you're making?  Challenge those.
*   **Explain Your Reasoning:** The *how* is often more important than the *what*.  A correct answer with poor reasoning is weaker than a flawed answer with strong, demonstrated logic.



Good luck! Let me know if you’d like to discuss solutions after you’ve had a chance to think about them.
